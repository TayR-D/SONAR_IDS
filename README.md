# SONAR_IDS
A front yard IDS

## Concept
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for areas with clear visibility but low supervision. It uses an ultrasonic sensor  to detect objects by measuring reflected sound waves. The system activates an LED light if an object is present for 3 seconds. If the object remains for another 3 seconds, it triggers an alarm to alert the caretaker and deter the intruder. This ensures effective monitoring with a simple, escalating response.
